= Compilation =

sfengine use CMake cross-plateform open-source build system.

First, [http://code.google.com/p/sfengine/source/checkout check-out the svn repository] to download source.<br/>
Then you have to download two dependencies : [http://www.boost.org/ Boost] 1.41.0 or above, and [http://sfml.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/sfml/branches/sfml2.tar.gz?view=tar SFML 2.0] snapshot.

== Windows ==

  * [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html Download CMake Win32 installer] and install
  * Launch cmake-gui. In the "Where is the source code" box, type the sfengine root directory.
  * CMake have to find SFML dependency. It uses macros to define paths :
     * SFML_INCLUDEDIR / SFML_LIBRARYDIR
    You can define them with "Add entry" button.
  * Press Configure button and choose your target compiler.
  * You now just have to go to the build directory and open your solution or project and compile it !

== Unix ==

  * Download CMake using
{{{
sudo apt-get install cmake
}}}
  or using [http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html this link]
  * Goto your sfengine root path, and generate cmake files.
{{{
cd sfengine/
cmake . 
}}}
  * Then compile the library using the generated Makefile
{{{
make
}}}
